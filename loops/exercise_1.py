# 1. Loop and Print

# Add some code inside the following for loop to print the current value of num on each iteration. Before you execute the code: What sequence of numbers do you expect to be printed?

for num in range(0, 11, 2):
    # pass # include your code here
    print(num)
# 0
# 2
# 4
# 6
# 8
# 10


# What sequence of numbers do you expect to be printed?

# range starts with 0 and ends at 10 with a step of 2 - expected 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
