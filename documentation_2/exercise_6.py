# Argument Signatures

# How many arguments does the str.join method expect? What happens if you call it with fewer or more arguments?

# str.join(iterable)

# The str.join method expects 1 argument which is an iterable where the elements are concatenated by the separator   
#  # Return a string which is the concatenation of the strings in iterable. A TypeError will be raised if there are any non-string values in iterable, including bytes objects. The separator between elements is the string providing this method.
