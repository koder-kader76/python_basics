# 7. Logical Conditions 1

# Predict the output of the following code:

if False or True:
    print("Yes!")
else:
    print("No...")

# the code is using a logical 'or' operator
# with a logical 'or' operator, only 1
# condition needs to be true for the whole
# expression to be truthy
# in this 'False or True' will evaluate to 
# truthy and the output will be "Yes!"
