# 1. Truthy vs. Falsy

# Without looking at your notes or the official documentation, try to recall all values that count as falsy in Python.

# before we look at falsy values;
# we look at expressions

# e.g
# literals: string, integers, floats, boolean
# arithmetic operations
# equality operations
# logical operations
# function call


# False, None
# numeric 0, 0.0, 0j (complex)
# empty string, ''
# empty collections: [], (), {}, set(), frozenset(), range(0)
# function calls that return None, e.g print()
