# 8. Logical Conditions 2

# Predict the output of the following code:

if True and False:
    print("Yes!")
else:
    print("No...")

# the above code is using an 'and' operator
# for the 'and' operator, both operands
# need to evaluate to truthy before the 
# the expression returns a truthy value
# In this case, the operand on the left is 
# False so the expression will evaluate to
# falsy and the output will be "No..."
