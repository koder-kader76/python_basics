# 7. Equality

# Predict the output of the code shown below. 
# When you run the code, do you see what you 
# expected? Why or why not?

list1 = [2, 6, 4]
list2 = [2, 6, 4]

print(list1 == list2)

# Output: True
# list1 == list2 is performing an equality  
# operation which basically checks if both 
# lists contain the same values

# if the operation is list1 is list2, which 
# checks if both lists are referencing the 
# same list object, then the output will be 
# False
